# Shape Manipulation with jQuery

This is a web page that allows users to dynamically add and remove shapes using jQuery. The shapes can be customized by type, color, and size.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage

- Click the "Add Shape" button to add a new shape.
- Select the shape type, color, and size using the controls.
- Click the "Remove Shape" button to remove the last shape added.

## Additional Notes

- Shapes will slide in from the left side of the container.
- A space will be maintained between shapes.
- Shape size is limited to a minimum of 20 pixels and a maximum of 400 pixels.
- Animations need to complete before adding or removing shapes to prevent spamming.
- The project uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and animation.
